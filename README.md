# LoadInDownstateBookmarklet

Yes I know this is a weird way to share this but I couldn't figure out how else to do it.

HOW TO USE:
Click and drag the following link to the bookmarks bar. Click it to reload pages through the Downstate proxy server and access library resources from off campus.

<a href="javascript:void(location.href=%22http://newproxy.downstate.edu/login?url=%22+location.href)">this link</a>

Tested and works with: UpToDate, Bates Visual Guide, BMJ Best Practice (if an article is already opened)

Issues with Net Anatomy, will load in the proxy but you’ll be on the nosubscription site. Probably easier to just bookmark the Downstate link to Net Anatomy, but you can theoretically use this and then just delete the “/nosubscription/notvalidip.htm” off the URL to access the main page.
